# Running the master container

To successfully run the master controller from within a container, we need to
mount the docker socket inside the container and expose the port used to
communicate with the outside world. E.g. if the container's tag is sip-master,
run as follows:

`docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -p 12345:12345 sip-master`
