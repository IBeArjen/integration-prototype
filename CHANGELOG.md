## \[0.3.0\] - 2017-10-xx
### Added

  a docker
  container. This can be found in the `zmq_logging_aggregator` folder.
### Changed
- Updated modules throughout SIP to make use of standard Python Logging.
  Removed use of a global Python logging object defined in
  `sip/common/logging_api.py`.
### Removed
- Logging code in the `sip.common` module which is now deprecated:
  - `sip/common/logging_aggregator.py`
  - `sip/common/logging_api.py`
  - `sip/common/logging_handlers.py`
  - `sip/common/logging_server.py`
### Fixed
- Updated top level README.md file. This is still out of date and will be
  updated as part of a future documentation update activity.

### Deprecated
- `sip_run.py` has been marked deprecated.  

## \[0.2.2\] - 2017-10-02
### Changed
- Unit test coverage filter in the Jenkins file to omit files which do not need
  testing.
- Jenkins' 'Analysis' stage no longer affects the build status, ending our
  perpetual state of unstableness.
### Fixed
- Unit test naming conventions. All unit tests files should be prefixed with
  with `test_`, examples with `example_`, and test mock objects with `mock_`.
  For more information see
  [SIP: Unit test naming convensions](https://confluence.ska-sdp.org/display/WBS/SIP%3A+Unit+test+naming+conventions).
- Various PEP-8 and PyLint errors in unit tests.
- The 'success' post-build status crashed the Jenkins build due to typo's in the
  commands.
### Removed
- Python modules in requirements.txt related to non core SIP functions. These
  these should be moved into their own module but for now are simply disabled.
- A number of broken unit tests have been marked as skipped and their file
  names prefixed with `disabled_`.
