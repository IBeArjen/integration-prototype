"""Implements a simple test imaging pipeline using Spark and the OSKAR imager.

This pipeline makes dirty images from all Measurement Sets in a specified
directory, the name of which is given on the command line.

Usage: spark-submit spark_imager_test.py <settings_file> <dir> [partitions]

Each Measurement Set is processed on a different Spark cluster node, so there
should be enough input Measurement Sets to parallelize the work effectively.
(For example, each Measurement Set could contain data for a different
frequency channel.)

Input visibility datasets are not placed in RDDs here. Instead, the initial
RDD contains only the names of the input data files. Gridded visibilities
(or weights) are then reduced using a new RDD. If uniform weighting
is selected, the reduced weights grid is sent to cluster nodes using a
Spark Broadcast variable, before using it to make a second pass of the
data for the actual gridding.

The pipeline can be configured to make a separate dirty image from each
Measurement Set, or to combine the visibility data from all of them into
one dirty image. In the latter case, the visibility grids from each node are
combined into a single grid, and the image is then finalised by
the driver program.
