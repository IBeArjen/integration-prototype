# Data Models

## Description

This package contains a library of modules which provide both in-memory and 
buffer (file format) representations SDP data models. It will also contain
functions and classes that support conversion between data formats of different
types or different versions.

***Note: In SIP code as we are using ARL to provide most, if not all of the 
`core_processing` functionality it is very likely that we will have to adopt
data models from ARL and therefore potentially deviate from those in the SDP
architecture. This should be reviewed over time against the SDP Data Model
architecture view (below).***
