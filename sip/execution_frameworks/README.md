# SIP Execution Frameworks

## Description

This package groups libraries and services, which provide the implementation 
of any custom (SDP specific) or modified off-the-shelf Execution Frameworks 
used by Science Pipeline workflows.

In the SIP code this is expected to mainly consist of custom Docker images
and scripts used to configure an Execution Framework runtime.
