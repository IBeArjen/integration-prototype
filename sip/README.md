# SIP: Top level code folder

## Roles and Responsibilities

Code in this folder tree is organised according to the the SDP System-level
Module Decomposition View \[1\] (see figure below), with additional details
drawn from the from other SDP Architecture documents.

Leaf-level code folders are designed as much as possible to be independently
deployable and testable software components in the form of service applications,
pipeline or workflow scripts, and supporting libraries.
