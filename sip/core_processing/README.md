# SIP Core Processing Packages

## Description

Libraries implementing core SDP-specific data processing.

**Contains:**

- Processing components library
- Receive components library

###Â Processing Library

A library of radio astronomy and interferometry algorithm implementations
consuming and producing data according to SDP (in memory) Data Models.

These should implement a standardised processing component interface to
make them as much as possible agnostic to how they are used in Science
Pipeline Workflows or what Execution Framework is calling them.

### Receive library

A library of functions for receiving data from CSP and LFAA (for transient
buffer data). Received data will be both written to the buffer for offline
processing as well as handed directly to real-time processing pipelines.

*NOTE(BM):  Not sure this description is correct as we probably don't want
these functions writing to the buffer.*
