# SIP Core Processing Package(s)

## Roles and Responsibilities

This package contains a library of core, domain-specific, low level functions
needed to construct the data processing and data receive pipelines and
workflows.

Sub-packages in this folder should be used (where appropriate) to divide 
modules into groups of functions with a common role.

***NOTE***: *For SIP, we expect the majority of the functions of this package
will be provided by the SDP Algorithm Reference Library
([ARL](https://github.com/SKA-ScienceDataProcessor/algorithm-reference-library))
and therefore we do not expect to have much code in this package.*
