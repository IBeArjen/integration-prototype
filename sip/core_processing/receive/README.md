# Receive modules

A library of functions for receiving data from CSP and LFAA (for transient
buffer data). Received data will be both written to the buffer for offline
processing as well as handed directly to real-time processing pipelines.

***FIXME(BMo): Not sure this description is correct as we probably don't want
these functions writing to the buffer.***
