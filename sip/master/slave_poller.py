"""Slave poller.

A SlavePoller runs in a separate thread and once a second looks at the
status of all the slave controllers using the Paas service.

The states of states of all the slaves is then checked against a list of
those that need to be running for the system to be considered available,
degraded or unavailable and an appropriate event posted.
