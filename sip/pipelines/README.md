# Science Pipeline Workflows

## Description

Data-driven pipelines configured by Processing Blocks, expressed in terms of a
language as executed by the Workflow Engine using an Execution Framework.

Specifies the steps necessary to execute a data-driven workflow, which will
typically involve:

- Configuring the buffer to provide required Data Islands
- Creating Data queues for dynamic data
- Initialising Quality Assessment to generate appropriate metrics
- Using Model Database to extract a Science Data Model
- Employing Execution Framework instances to execute workflows on available
  processing resources.
- Update the Science Data Product Catalogue in the Data Preparation and
  Delivery

*NOTE(BM): I'm not sure all of the functions listed above from the SDP module
view is entirely clear.*
