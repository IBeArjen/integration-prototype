# SIP Configuration Service (Redis variant)

Placeholder for the Redis based Configuration Service.

This folder will contain the client code, standalone deployment script 
(eg docker-compose.yml) and any unit tests and examples used to demonstrate 
or verify this service.

Scripts for a larger SIP deployment making use of this service are found in 
the top level `deploy` folder.
