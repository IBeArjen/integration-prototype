## How to provision and run visibility ingest pipeline in P3 using 3 receivers and 3 senders

------------------------------------------------

### 1. Create a Swarm Cluster 

Create swarm cluster with 1 master node and 6 workers either by using the web UI or CLI

Check if swarm cluster was created successfully

```bash
docker node ls
```

TO interact with the cluster via the docker client.Follow the instructions on this link 
https://confluence.ska-sdp.org/display/WBS/Container+Clusters

If not, add the workers to the swarm mode - Instructions can be found in the following link
https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/add-nodes/

------------------------------------------------

### 2. Ansible: Configuring the hosts file

Update hosts file with the correct hostname and IP address under swarm leader and swarm worker

------------------------------------------------

### 3. Ansible: Update docker stack and config file

The visibility sender config file are in the /tools/csp_visibility_sender directory. Update vis_sender_config.json, 
vis_sender_config1.json and vis_sender_config2.json file with the correct IP Address.

Make sure to use network IP (10.0.0.x) and not the floating IP. The network can be found by 

```bash
docker node inspect <nodename>
```

------------------------------------------------

### 4. Ansible: Provision the cluster

```bash
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts playbooks/p3_site.yml
```

------------------------------------------------

### 5. Docker Stack: Run the service 

Deploy the docker stack for the receiver from the vis_receiver folder

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml receiver
```

Then deploy the docker stack for the sender from the tools/csp_visibility_sender folder

```bash
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml sender
```

Each node will be created its own local volume. Data written can be found inside
/var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume name>/_data


The logs of the docker service can be viewed through

```bash
docker service logs <service name>
```

To remove all the service

```bash
docker stack <stack name>
```

------------------------------------------------

### 6. Troubleshooting

If you see the following error in the logs
dropped incomplete heap 4 (5669764/20930588 bytes of payload)

Then the buffer size needs to be increased and this can be done either by updating main.yml file 
inside sip.ingest role or logging into each node running the following command

```bash
sysctl net.core.rmem_max=2147483647
sysctl net.core.rmem_default=2147483647
```

------------------------------------------------

### 6. TO DO

1) Use Redis as a configuration database instead of the config file
