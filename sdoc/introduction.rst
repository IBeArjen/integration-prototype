Introduction
============

The SDP Integration Prototype (SIP) is an end-to-end prototype of the SDP code,
developed with the following goals.

* Testing of SDP interfaces (both internal and external).
* Testing and verification of the SDP architecture.
* Testing horizontal scaling of the SDP.
* Provide an extensible framework which can interface with other SDP
  prototyping activities.

The SIP code consists of a Python library and number of python scripts which
provide modules for the major SIP components and emulators for SDP interfaces.
